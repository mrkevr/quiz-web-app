# Spring Boot Quiz App
A multiple-choice question (MCQ) based quiz web application. It consumes my REST API, [quiz-app](https://github.com/mrkevr/quiz-app) to do the backend operations using Spring RestTemplate.

### Dependencies
Spring Boot Quiz App is powered by many powerful frameworks and third-party projects:
| Framework  |  Function |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)  | An open-source tool that makes it easier to use Java-based frameworks to create microservices and web apps.  |
| [Spring Boot Validation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/validation/beanvalidation.html)  |  A Spring interface used to validate objects. |
| [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) | A Java library tool that is used to minimize/remove the boilerplate code and save the precious time of developers during development by just using some annotations. In addition to it, it also increases the readability of the source code and saves space. |
| [Spring Webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webflux.html) | A Spring framework built on Project Reactor that supports reactive, asynchronous, and non-blocking programming for developing web applications. |
| [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) | A Java-based library used to create a web application. |
