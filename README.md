# Spring Boot Quiz App
A multiple-choice question (MCQ) based quiz web application. It uses my REST API, quiz-app to do the backend operations using Spring RestTemplate.

Spring Boot Quiz App is powered by many powerful frameworks and third-party projects:

| Framework  |  Operation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Spring Boot  | An open-source tool that makes it easier to use Java-based frameworks to create microservices and web apps.  |
| Spring Boot Validation  |  Spring Boot interface that you can use to validate objects. |
| Project Lombok | Java library tool that is used to minimize/remove the boilerplate code and save the precious time of developers during development by just using some annotations. In addition to it, it also increases the readability of the source code and saves space. |
| Spring Webflux | Framework built on Project Reactor that supports reactive, asynchronous, and non-blocking programming for developing web applications. |
| Thymeleaf | Java-based library used to create a web application. |
